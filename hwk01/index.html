		<h2>Super Flipside</h2>
		<p>What I really like about this game is it's ability to multitask as a two player or (very challenging) single player game. I also really like the simple mechanics; they feel super easy to understand, while still having a very difficult game. Most importantly I really like the 2 color scheme. I think for the game that I develop I'm going to go with a 2 or 3 color scheme as well.</p>

		<h2>Sinuous</h2>
		<p>The best part about this game is that you almost don't need to be told anything going in. The controls are intuitive, the mechanics are easy, they dont even need to give any instructions on how to play. I also like this game because of it's simple aesthetic, along with it's potential as both a mobile and desktop game.</p>
